"""Select the runnable kernel files CI must exercise.

Given a list of changed files on stdin, decide
which runnable scripts CI should execute. A "runnable" file is one that has a
`__main__` guard — the harness invokes it as `python <file> -p <platform>`.

Selection rules
---------------
1. A changed file under ``models/`` pulls in not just itself but every file
   that (transitively) imports it. Model kernels are split across many sibling
   modules (``config``, ``rmsnorm``, ``qkv_proj_rope`` …) and a leaf change can
   break any downstream kernel, so we walk the reverse-import graph and run
   every runnable dependent. Only ``models/`` needs this: any ``examples/``
   change is already covered by rule 2's full-suite run.
2. Any runtime-affecting change **outside** ``models/`` selects *all* runnable
   ``examples/`` files as a smoke test. Documentation and documentation-only
   control files are explicitly exempt because they cannot change generated
   kernels or runtime behavior. Unknown paths remain runtime-affecting so the
   safe default is still the full smoke suite.

Imports in this repo are bare module names (``from qkv_proj_rope import ...``)
resolved against the running script's own directory, so the reverse-import
graph is built per-directory keyed by file basename.

The selected, deduplicated, sorted file list is printed space-separated on a
single line to stdout.
